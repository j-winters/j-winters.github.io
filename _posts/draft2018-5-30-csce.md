title: Linking cumulative culture to dynamical systems and universal computation
---

Mark Changizi made an interesting point linking the advent of writing as opening up computational potential for culture and cognition to act as a *universal* Turing machine:

When viewed in this way, one consequence is that without writing cultural evolution is limited in its cumulative capacity. And this limitation comes from our ability to perform computations. So it's surprising that insights from computation are (often) conspicuoulsy absent from work in cultural evolution. For instance, computer scientists have known since the 90s that a certain subset of dynamical systems are capable of performing universal computation ([Langton, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727899090064V)). Using [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)(henceforth, CA<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>), Langton provides a deep, fundamental connection between the theories of dynamical systems and computation:

* CA capture *phase transitions* between periodic and chaotic dynamics;
* CA exhibit the most complex behaviour when existing in the phase transition between highly ordered (periodic regime) and highly disordered (chaotic regime) states;
* CA in this transition regime, as opposed to CAs in periodic and chaotic regimes, exhibit the greatest potential for the emergence of (universal) computation.

For a dynamical system to be capable of universal computation it must perform three primitive computational operations: *information storage*, *information transmission*, and *information modification*. Storage requires that the dynamics are capable of preserving local state information for arbitrarily long times. Transmission requires that the dynamics are able to propagate information in the form of signals over arbitrarily long distances. Modification refers to the creation of a new information through the interaction or combination of stored and transmitted information. 

These minimal requirements form the basis for linking different types of dynamical systems to their ability to perform computation. Without going into a lengthy overview (see [Computation, Dynamics and the Phase-Transition](https://theory.org/complexity/cdpt/html/cdpt.html)), when dynamical systems exist in a transition regime they allow propagating structures (transmission) to interact with static structures (storage), producing a structure which propagates in the opposite direction (modification). This is different from periodic and chaotic regimes where these systems either quickly transition to a highly ordered (in the case of periodic) or a highly disordered state (in the case of chaotic). What Langton successfully demonstrated was that certain classes of CA map onto these types of dynamical regimes:

Importantly, for Class IV CA, which is the only class capable of performing universal computation, it is the very long transients of this class that explains its computational capacity. I think this work linking computation to dynamical theories provides the basis for rigorously discriminating between cumulative and non-cumulative cultures. Non-cumulative cultures have short transients whereas cumulative cultures spend most of thier time in a transient state. Human culture can be thought of as existing in a long transient: many traditions seem to sit between an ordered and a chaotic state for extended periods. All other animal cultures, by contrast, seem to quickly transition to state (think: XXXX). 

You can think about this in terms of information loss. Periodic regimes are characterised by low amounts of information loss. This is advantageous when you want something to be robust (i.e., insensitive to perturbations). Periodic regimes are therefore too rigid to compute complex tasks; changes are rapidly erased and the flow of information to the components of a system is low. Chaotic regimes, by contrast, are extremely sensitive to perturbations and therefore have high amounts of information loss. However, this extreme sensitivity is advantageous in that it makes the system flexible (think of weather patterns). Chaotic regimes provide unreliable responses to inputs: the unbounded spread of perturbations and noise prevent effective information transmission and storage. In both cases, there is little interaction between storage and transmission when compared to the transition regime. Transition regimes are special in that they reach an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility: there is global stability, in that a local perturbation does not swamp the system and result in massive information loss, but also flexibility in that information loss is allowed locally (allowing a system to escape non-optimal configurations). As such, systems in a transition regime react reliability to inputs, but at the same time are capable of producing a large number of possible outcomes.

Now, the ability to perform computations is nothing new for cognition, but an important distinction needs to be made between computation and {\em distributed computation}. Distributed computation refers to any process conducted by multiple agents or entities that involves the storage, transmission, and modification of information ([Lizier, 2010: 2](http://lizier.me/joseph/publications/2010-Lizier-LocalInfoDynamics-Thesis.pdf)). Thinking of cultural evolution in relation to distributed computation goes a long way to redefining cumulative culture as *existing in a transition regime where a population is capable of performing distributed computation on cultural information*.



### Footnotes
<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: CA are systems composed of finite state automata, i.e., cells, arranged in a D-dimensional lattice. Each cell takes as input the states of the cells in a given neighbourhood, and a transition function (i.e., how does the state of the cell change or not change given an input).
