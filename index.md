I'm a cognitive scientist working in the domains of cultural evolution, language, and communication. My current academic home is at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History](http://www.shh.mpg.de/en) in Jena, where I'm a postdoctoral researcher with the [Minds and Traditions Research Group](http://www.shh.mpg.de/94549/themintgroup) (Group leader: [Olivier Morin](https://sites.google.com/site/sitedoliviermorin/)).

Previously, I was based at the [University of Edinburgh](http://ed.ac.uk) in the [Centre for Language Evolution](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/), and completed my PhD under the supervision of [Simon Kirby](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/) and [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/).
