I'm a cognitive and behavioural scientist working in the domains of cultural evolution, technology, and communication. My current academic home is at [UM6P](https://um6p.ma/) in Morocco, where I'm an Assistant Professor in the [School of Collective Intelligence](https://sci.um6p.ma/). 

I have an ongoing affiliation with my former home, the [Minds and Traditions Research Group](http://www.shh.mpg.de/94549/themintgroup) (Group leader: [Olivier Morin](https://sites.google.com/site/sitedoliviermorin/)) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History](http://www.shh.mpg.de/en) in Jena. Previously, I was based at the [University of Edinburgh](http://ed.ac.uk) in the [Centre for Language Evolution](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/), and completed my PhD under the supervision of [Simon Kirby](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/) and [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/).

I also founded a [Replicated Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com) (a group blog that focuses on the evolution of both language and culture).
